# External Installation - Method 1 (using a script)

> [!WARNING]
> Remember we'll format the external drive!
> Back up any existing data you care about.
> Another thing to mention, this usually does not work at all for most people.

> [!TIP]
> If it fails or you have issues, or just want to do manual partitioning (which often works better) follow the [alternative installation guide here](/external-installation-manual).
## Installation scripts
Put the kernel (bzImage, and the bootargs if you need it), initramfs (initramfs.cpio.gz), and your distro `psxitarch.tar.xz/gz` on the root of a FAT32 formatted drive, like so:

### Manual format for big drives
If the drive is larger than 32GB, Windows will dastardly act like it can't format it in FAT32, but only in NTFS or ExFAT, which is just wrong, as FAT32 supports up to 2TB drives.
To fix it, go ahead and download the mythical [Rufus](https://rufus.ie) program.

- Select "List USB Hard Drives"
- Select "Non bootable" as a type of format
- Select "MBR" as partition scheme
- Select "FAT32" as filesystem

Click start and wait.
Once done, place the files on the drive.
Plug your drive on the PS4 and continue.

## Installation commands
Now that the storage is covered, here comes the moment of truth. You'll be sent to the Rescue Shell, which will look like this:

- Type `install-psxitarch.sh`
	- If it fails, go to the [Installation Issues](/issues#installation-issues), or use the [alternative method](external-installation-manual).

Hydrate yourself while you wait. It'll take a while.

After that is done, it should boot into the desktop. If it doesn't, run
```bash
resume-boot
```
